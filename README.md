# hero_database

This is a database for superheroes
I am fetching data from a superhero API that using axios

As far as the tasks go
i was able to implement the design quite alright
but was having some trouble displaying the response from the API

//to fix that, i decided to render my search input component witin my App.js component and pass
the API data in a filtered array within a search function that i also assed as props into my ui component

// I was unable to sort the displaed information in terms of date, as the API i used did not have date.

//i also had some issues with the filter components, i was unable to view the date being rendered.
